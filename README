build
-----
Currently supported build tools are make and microsoft visual studio C++ 2010,
also known as msvc.

make
~~~~
In build/make/Makefile, set GTEST_INC_DIR to the directory containing gtest's
include folder (named gtest). Set GTEST_LIB_DIR to the directory containing
gtest's library (libgtest.a). In the shell, in directory build/make, run just
+make+ with no arguments.

msvc 2010
~~~~~~~~~
In cppkoan's project settings, for all configurations, add the directory
containing gtest's include folder to `C/C++ | General | Additional Include
Directories', and add the directory containing gtest's library (gtestd.lib and
gtest.lib respectively) to `Linker | General | Additional Library Directories'.
