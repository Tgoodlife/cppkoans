cppkoans
========

Learn C++ by little exercises. Inspired by http://rubykoans.com/[ruby koans].


build
-----
Currently supported build tools are make and microsoft visual studio C++ 2010,
also known as msvc. Building by default also runs the koans.

make
~~~~
In the shell, in directory build/make, run just +make+ with no arguments. The
cppkoans executable is generated in build/make.

msvc 2010
~~~~~~~~~
The cppkoans.exe executable is generated in build/msvc/{Debug,Release}.

running the koans
-----------------
Building, see chapter `build', by default also runs the koans. If you want to
run them explicitely, execute the cppkoans executable from your command line.
See the chapter `build' where the executables are.

To make this a little bit more convenient, you can run them also as explained in
the following:

make / *nix::
In directory build/make/, run +make run+.

msvc::
In msvc, you can run the executable explicitely via menu `Debug | Start
Debugging' (F5) or `Debug | Start Without Debugging' (Ctrl+F5).
