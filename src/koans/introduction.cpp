// The 2nd argument of the TEST macro is a brief sentence stating the essence

// The detailed information often contains references to further
// information. Often multipe references are given, so you also learn where
// within a given source to find more information on a given topic.
//
// Often used references are referred to by aliases defined in the following
// list:
//
// - TC++PL4: The book 'The C++ Programming Language Fourth Edition' by Bjarne
//   Stroustrup.
//
// - TStd11: The ISO C++ standard [C++11]. In short just 'the standard'.
//   Officially known as 'ISO International Standard ISO/IEC 14882:2011(E) â€“
//   Programming Language C++'. http://isocpp.org/std/the-standard. N3337 is
//   the freely downloadable working draft version which for practical
//   purposes is identical to the official proprietary version:
//   http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3337.pdf.
//
// - TStd14: Analogous to TStd11, but for C++14. N4140 is the freely
